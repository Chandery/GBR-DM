# A Diffusion Model with General Biomedical Representations for Sparse-View CT Reconstruction (GBR-DM)

## Overview
This repository presents the implementation of the Diffusion Model with General Biomedical Representations (GBR-DM), a pioneering methodology aimed at enhancing three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) reconstruction using sparse two-dimensional X-ray images. By leveraging cross-modal feature contrastive learning, GBR-DM proficiently extracts latent three-dimensional information and establishes alignment between the latent spaces of X-ray and CT modalities.

## Research Context
Computed Tomography (CT) is a widely employed imaging modality in clinical practice; however, traditional CT protocols are frequently challenged by issues such as elevated radiation exposure and prolonged imaging durations. This project endeavors to mitigate these concerns by employing sparse X-ray views, thereby reducing both the associated risks and costs while preserving reconstruction quality.

The GBR-DM incorporates advanced diffusion modeling techniques, showcasing superior performance in voxel-level evaluation metrics, specifically Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), when compared to existing classical methods and state-of-the-art generative models.

## Features
- Efficient extraction of latent three-dimensional information from two-dimensional X-ray images.
- Comprehensive performance benchmarking against various classical and state-of-the-art models.
- Open-source code implementation provided for reproducibility and to facilitate further research endeavors.
